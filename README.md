## Summary
With this application, I have learn new JS concept (such as working with table). I'm more comfortable building and reusing the DOM and functions. Also, I had so much fun styling this application.

As I have progressed through my journey as a software developer, I've fall in love with the art of crafting the code. Every little detail matters. I'll be continuing to improve my craftmenship.
