## Summary
This is my fourth application. With this one, I have learned new JS concepts (such as working with tables, and rows). I'm comfortable playing around the DOM and functions. Also, I had so much fun styling this application.

As I have progressed through my journey as a software developer, I've fallen in love with the art of crafting the code. Every little detail matters. I'll be continuing to improve my craftsmanship.
